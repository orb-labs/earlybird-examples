# Earlybird Fee Collectors

## **Setup**

Update `/script/setup.sh` with your mnemonic phrase where it says `ADD YOUR MNEMONIC HERE`
Run a local hardhat or select an environment other than testnet in `/script/setup.sh`
If deploying non-locally, be sure to update the RPC_URL vars in the `script/environmentVariables/$ENVIRONMENT` -- the deploy script will iterate over each chain file in the environment-specific directory, attempting to deploy to each chain 


---

### **Deployment**
Run `script/deploy.sh`
